                    As time passes, the discourses and innovations are to be considered unprecedented. The necessity to
                    acknowledge and consider the previous innovations to reflect a greater future is pivotal. Hence,
                    such a notion serves to be the essence of development.</span> <br><br>

                    Considering the changes and developments occurring in the world, global challenges remain to
                    increase in dynamic with global development. Therefore, it lies on the hands of the current youth
                    and future generations to mobilize contemporary ideas and discourses to resolve the ever growing
                    global challenges. With the rapid technological advancements, the youths bear the potential to

                                        The lack of infrastructure in rural communities significantly impacts the lives
                                        of the people living in them. With the surging rate of globalization and rapid
                                        change of digitization, these communities are further left behind on
                                        infrastructure, one of the most prominent examples would be the unequal and
                                        inadequate educational and healthcare infrastructures.
                                        Comprehensive strategies are needed to deal with the infrastructure gap by
                                        recognizing the different starting points of rural areas and villages, and
                                        co-designing infrastructure pathways from the bottom-up while at the same time
                                        building bridges with the essential top-down strategies. Development programs
                                        and solutions with the use of technology are necessary approaches to overcome
                                        infrastructural barriers in rural regions such as remoteness from society,
                                        insufficient assistance of basic needs, as well as the lack of rural resilience.

                                    The well-being of the world population has depended on the earth’s ecosystem and its biodiversity since the dawn of history. Yet, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss is still happening at unprecedented rates, imposing threats not only towards nature itself, but also the people who live in it. While the environmental aspect is indisputably a pressing issue to address, it is equally urgent to highlight the socio-economic impact of this degradation. On June 2021, UNEP released a synthesis report for the #GenerationRestoration movement as a call to action to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems worldwide. “Degradation is already affecting the well-being of an estimated 3.2 billion people — that is 40 percent of the world’s population,” UNEP executive director Inger Andersen and FAO director-general Qu Dongyu, wrote in the report. A comprehensive approach to sustainable initiatives is necessary in order to overcome the challenges in ecosystem restoration efforts, and that includes the deployment of science and technology where it is feasible.

                                        The world has moved on from the age of armored warfare which began in the 1940s.
                                        Massive technological advancements have been made in the field of combat and
                                        weaponry since that time. We are now at a new age. An age where ballistic
                                        missiles can be launched from a different continent, an age where missile
                                        defense systems are so advanced it can pinpoint incoming rockets and explode
                                        them mid-air with little need of human intervention (iron dome), and an age
                                        where tanks and jets can roam the battlefield unmanned. All these advancements
                                        were largely thanks to the 21st-century-born invention called ‘artificial
                                        intelligence or in short: AI. AI has seeded countless useful day-to-day
                                        use-cases in which we mostly take for granted. It is rooted in the applications
                                        we use, the phone we carry everywhere we go, the search engine we heavily rely
                                        on, the cars we drive, and the list goes on. However, artificial intelligence is
                                        a technology that has the ability to reap havoc on targets with a press of a
                                        button. If a war were to break out, it would be a totally different kind of
                                        warfare. This then raises many questions-- should a new, updated war playbook be
                                        created to anticipate and prevent the potential mass destruction a new war can
                                        inflict, especially to the innocent?
